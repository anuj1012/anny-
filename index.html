        <h1>Happy Anniversary My Dear Riya!</h1>
        <p>Today marks another beautiful year of our journey together, and I couldn’t be more grateful to have you by my side. From the laughter we share to the challenges we’ve overcome, every moment with you has been a treasure. Your love, support, and unwavering belief in us have made me a better person. As we celebrate this special day, I want you to know how deeply I cherish you and our memories. Here’s to many more years of love, joy, and adventures together. I love you more than words can express.
